# Picture Lightbox

Click the image to view it in an enlarged, focused lightbox overlay.

*   **Zoom & Pan:** Zoom follows the cursor; click and drag to pan the zoomed image.
*   **Multiple Images:** If multiple images are present (e.g., in the `picture` field or detected in glossary entries), you can navigate between them using arrow keys or on-screen buttons. Only the first image shows in the main card view.
*   **Glossary Images:** Images found within glossary definitions (like those from 画像付き-絵でわかる日本語) can be displayed in the lightbox.
*   **Lightbox Grid View:** Toggle between the default single-image view and a grid view showing thumbnails of all available images.
