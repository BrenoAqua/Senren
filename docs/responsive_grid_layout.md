# Responsive Grid Layout
Take full control over your card's layout. You can arrange the **Word** and **Picture** side-by-side (**Horizontal**) or stack them on top of each other (**Vertical**). You can also flip the order placing the picture on the left, right, top, or bottom, independently for different screen sizes.
