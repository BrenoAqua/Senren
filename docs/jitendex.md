# Stylization Changes for Jitendex (and similar dictionaries)

Enhanced display for dictionary entries, particularly those generated by Yomitan with structured data.

## Click Interactions
*   Example sentences smoothly expand/collapse on **click**, and their border color is highlighted when in the expanded state.

## Hover Interactions
*   Antonyms, cross-references, and notes smoothly expand/collapse on **hover**.
*   Furigana appears smoothly on example sentences when **hovered**.
*   Elements start with 50% opacity and transition to full opacity (100%) when **hovered**.
