# Kaishi Template
These are the settings I use for Kaishi. When I finished Kaishi, I merged it with my mining deck (while keeping its original note type). Since then, Iâ€™ve made a lot of edits to make it look more like Senren.

### Installation Instructions
1. Go to **Browse** in Anki.
2. Select the **Kaishi 1.5k** Note Type.
3. Click on **Cards**.
4. Replace the contents of the **Front Template**, **Back Template**, and **Styling** sections with the provided files:
   - [`front.html`](https://github.com/BrenoAqua/Senren/blob/main/Template/kaishi/front.html)
   - [`back.html`](https://github.com/BrenoAqua/Senren/blob/main/Template/kaishi/front.html)
   - [`styling.css`](https://github.com/BrenoAqua/Senren/blob/main/Template/kaishi/styling.css)

This template shares some features with Senren, but not all of them. These include: 

### The overall appearance is the same, but instead of a grid with two rows for Word and Picture, it uses just one row, like in the original Kaishi note type.

### Colors for Every Pitch Accent
- ğŸ”µ **Heiban** 
- ğŸ”´ **Atamadaka**
- ğŸŸ  **Nakadaka**
- ğŸŸ¢ **Odaka**
- ğŸŸ£ **Kifuku**
> This isn't automatic, as the color will only be applied if you tag the card. For example, if the pitch is heiban, you need to add the `heiban` tag to the card for its corresponding color to be applied.

### Custom Dark Mode
- Easily toggle between the default theme (light or original dark mode) and custom dark mode with a black background.
> It works the same way as Senren, and it also supports light mode.

### English Translations and Furigana Hover Effects
- English translations appear when hovering over Japanese sentences.
- Sentence Furigana appears when hovering over Japanese sentences.
> These hover effects use the same styling as Senren.
