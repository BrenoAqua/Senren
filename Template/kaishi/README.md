# Kaishi Template
These are the settings I use for Kaishi. When I finished Kaishi, I merged it with my mining deck (while keeping its original note type). Since then, Iâ€™ve made a lot of edits to make it look more like my [mining deck](https://github.com/BrenoAqua/Senren).

To install it, go to Tools  > Manage Note Types > Select Kaishi 1.5k > Click on **Cards**.
Then, copy and paste the contents of [`front.html`](https://github.com/BrenoAqua/Senren/blob/main/Template/kaishi/front.html) into the Front Template section, [`back.html`](https://github.com/BrenoAqua/Senren/blob/main/Template/kaishi/front.html) into the Back Template section and [`styling.css`](https://github.com/BrenoAqua/Senren/blob/main/Template/kaishi/styling.css) into the Styling section.

This template shares some features with [Senren](https://github.com/BrenoAqua/Senren), but not all of them. These include: 

### The overall appearance is the same, but instead of a grid with two rows for Word and Picture, it uses just one row, like in the original Kaishi note type.

### Colors for Every Pitch Accent
- ðŸ”µ **Heiban** 
- ðŸ”´ **Atamadaka**
- ðŸŸ  **Nakadaka**
- ðŸŸ¢ **Odaka**
- ðŸŸ£ **Kifuku**
> This isn't automatic, as the color will only be applied if you tag the card. For example, if the pitch is heiban, you need to add the `heiban` tag to the card for its corresponding color to be applied.

### Custom Dark Mode
- Easily toggle between the default theme (light or original dark mode) and custom dark mode with a black background.
> It works the same way, and it also supports light mode.

### English translations appear when hovering over Japanese sentences.
> This uses the same hover effect as [Senren](https://github.com/BrenoAqua/Senren).

### Sentence Furigana appears when hovering over Japanese sentences.
