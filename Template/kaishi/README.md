# Kaishi Template
These are the settings I use for Kaishi. When I finished Kaishi, I merged it with my mining deck (while keeping its original note type). Since then, Iâ€™ve made a lot of edits to make it look more like my [mining deck](https://github.com/BrenoAqua/Senren).

To install it, go to Tools  > Manage Note Types > Select Kaishi 1.5k > Click on **Cards**.
Then, copy and paste the contents of [`front.html`](https://github.com/BrenoAqua/Senren/blob/main/Template/kaishi/front.html) into the Front Template section, [`back.html`](https://github.com/BrenoAqua/Senren/blob/main/Template/kaishi/front.html) into the Back Template section and [`styling.css`](https://github.com/BrenoAqua/Senren/blob/main/Template/kaishi/styling.css) into the Styling section.
